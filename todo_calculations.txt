7AGNR:
 - Scaling of 7AGNR wrt U and length of GNR.
    -> What Parameters for calculation?
        - Enforce singlet or triplet solution?
        - Initialization random / zeroone / ... ?

        == Study singlet/triplet difference.
           y-axis: singlet-triplet diff, x-axis: length
         == Error in plotting script -> fix and send pics to K

    == Plot the total absolute magnetization (abs sum of spin-density) vs varying U
        - Vary length of ANGR

periodic 8ZGNR:
  - scaling of magnetization of 8ZGNR vs 8ZGNR with "blob"
    == Paper stability of edge magnetization
    == Both spin channels get different solution -> Two different plots (or two different colors)

Stone-Wales:
 - Stone-Wales for periodic GNR
    -> Location of defect?
 - Stone-Wales (5/7) for finite GNF
    -> Location of defect?
        == Center

Finite Open Shell Systems:
 -


GNF Scaling Mem vs Size:
 == Full memory usage


General:
 - Axis and plotting style of periodic systems?
    == Two unit cells (mark one unit cell with rectangle)

 - Include reference pictures from books / papers? E.g. Yazyev
    == Don't include
