Updated ToDo:

Molecules:
    - Total absolute magnetization singlet / triplet start from 0.0 (add calc 0.0 - 1.0)
    - Singlet-Triplet energy diff in 1 plot, change color palette to scaling

    - GNF with SW: Qualitative plots (Magnetization),
        -> discussion of magnetization difference, HOMO-LUMO gap
        -> Check quintet Solution
        -> SW raises U level for spin-polarization?
            -> plot magnetization vs U (check pristine gnf vs gnf-SW): 2 different sizes.

    - AGNR Termini, put 1 size (len 4/8) for triplet / singlet in main thesis part, then
        len 2, 8/4, 16 in appendix

Periodic:
    - ZGNR / AGNR: Use U=1.7 for all. Replace "H" with "U".

    - GNR + SW: Squish plots (vertically longer, horizontally 1/3 from pristine band structure),
        put next to each other: pristine band structure, 3x unit length pristine (1/3 size),
                                hubbard band structure, 3x hubbard (1/3 size)
                                3x ul SW and SW-hubbard (1/3 size)


    blob: drop
    # - blob: blob only one side / blob less dense and reproduce plot like fig 4a) in paper edge-magnetism.
    #    -> Mag vs U
_______________________________________________________________________________

7AGNR:
 - Scaling of 7AGNR wrt U and length of GNR.
    -> What Parameters for calculation?
        - Enforce singlet or triplet solution?
        - Initialization random / zeroone / ... ?

        == Study singlet/triplet difference.
           y-axis: singlet-triplet diff, x-axis: length


    == Plot the total absolute magnetization (abs sum of spin-density) vs varying U
        - Vary length of ANGR

periodic 8ZGNR:
  - scaling of magnetization of 8ZGNR vs 8ZGNR with "blob"
    == Paper stability of edge magnetization
    == Both spin channels get different solution -> Two different plots (or two different colors)

Stone-Wales:
 - Stone-Wales for periodic GNR
    -> Location of defect?
 - Stone-Wales (5/7) for finite GNF
    -> Location of defect?
        == Center

Finite Open Shell Systems:
 -


GNF Scaling Mem vs Size:
 == Full memory usage


General:
 - Axis and plotting style of periodic systems?
    == Two unit cells (mark one unit cell with rectangle)

 - Include reference pictures from books / papers? E.g. Yazyev
    == Don't include
